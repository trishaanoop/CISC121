I used a LeetCode solution to understand how the flow of the program should work, particularly how the .pop() function removes the most recent opening bracket and how a dictionary is used to match each closing bracket with its correct opening pair. This bracket matching is essential because it ensures that every opening bracket is pared with the proper closing bracket in the correct order, which is the fundamental requirement for determining whether a parentheses sequence is valid.\n",

These sources larified how the problem breaks down into smaller subproblems and why storing previosult computed values makes the code efficient. I found these sources useful, as they provided a solid foundation that improved my understanding before creating my pseudocode and my draft code.\n",
        "2. After creating my draft code, I received an error, so I consulted another LeetCode solution to guide my revisions. Through analyzing the solution, I leader 2 specific changes I needed to make in roder for my code to run correctly. First, I corrected the recursive case, changing it from increasing a step, to decreasing it by 2 (because a two-step jump can be taken). I also fixed the base case. This source was very helpful in guiding my debugging process.\n",

        "  * The condition in findFirst (while left < right) was incorrect and caused early termination before finding the actual first index.\n",
        "  * The comparison logic (nums[mid] <= target) in the draft caused the pointer to move in the wrong direction, preventing the correct boundary from being detected\n",

Overall, ChatGPT played a key role in helping me understand why my code was failing and how to correct the logical errors.\n"

The first solution helped guide the creation of my pseudocode and gave me a clear understanding of how to approach the problem using the Dutch Flag method for sorting. This explanation was extremely useful in helping me structure my draft code. I also used a second LeetCode solution during my debugging process. By comparing mt draft code to the working solution (although both are a bit different), I identified the mistakes I made and understood why my original implementation was producing incorrect outputs. Making these corrections helped solidify my understanding of the algorithm and why each step is necessary.
